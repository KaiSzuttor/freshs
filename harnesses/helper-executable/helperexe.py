# This small program calls the harness script with the right parameters
# This is necessary, because lammps can be used in many ways (e.g. as
# a python or C/C++ library or as executable with the call 
# ./lammps < simuscript.in
# There is a job_scripts which cover the library cases.
# For the use with a C/C++ library proceed in the same way like
# with the python lib example with the difference that the job_script 
# must be your compiled program which writes the metadata in the end
# For calling lammps with ./lammps < simuscript.in you have to write
# your own harness script, which prepares the environment, makes the
# call, calculates the reaction coordinate and returns the data.
# refer to the 'ell' job_script in this case
