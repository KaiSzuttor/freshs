Test directory for FRESHS
*************************

To run all tests, type: make at the command line.

Currently implemented tests rely on the presence of Espresso (the espresso_spres and espresso_ffs tests)
or on the presence of the "ell" code made in the Schilling group (ell_spres and ell_ffs).

The ell code is distributed with this harness, so the ell tests should pass even if nothing else does.
