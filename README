This is the Flexible Rare Event Sampling Harness System (FRESHS)

FRESHS is a sampling harness system to carry out rare event simulations, using algorithms such as SPRES or FFS.

FRESHS is simulation-agnostic: it is tested against popular simulation programs (GROMACS, LAMPPS, ESPResSo) 
but you should find it easy to connect it to your own programs without recompiling them using our plug-in system. 

For details please refer to our homepage http://www.freshs.org/
For an introduction see the file INSTALL
