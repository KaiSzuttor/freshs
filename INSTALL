QUICK START
-----------

Please prepare your job_script which should be capable of storing and loading configuration snapshots and of returning the relevant metadata for the particular sampling method (at least reaction coordinate and calculation steps/time).

* SERVER
-----------

Open a terminal and start the server (you may edit the configuration file first):

cd server
python main_server.py -c server-sample.conf


* CLIENT(S)
-----------

Open another terminal and start the client, e.g.:

cd client
python main_client.py -c client-sample.conf

Thereby, the executable of your simulation and the harness script are read from the configuration file. According to your resources, you can connect multiple clients to the server.


* MPI
-----------

If you'd like to use a prefix for your executable, e.g. mpirun, then use

python main_client.py -c client-sample.conf -e "mpirun -np 8"


* NICENESS
-----------

If you run your simulation on the local machine and you'd like to nice the jobs, there is an option in the client's configuration file:

# set niceness of executable, 0 = disable
nice_job = 19


* TUNNEL
-----------

If you need a secure ssh tunnel to your local machine, the ssh tunnel can be enabled and the tunnelcommand can be specified in the configuration file of the client:

# ssh tunnel
ssh_tunnel = 1
# ssh tunnelcommand
ssh_tunnelcommand = ssh -N -L 10000:localhost:10000 tunneluser@tunnelhost
